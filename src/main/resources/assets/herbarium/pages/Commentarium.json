Before it wore off though, it started raining, and with the last bit of the effect, I saw that the water refused to stick to my skin and my cloths. The next day, I brewed some more and jumped into a nearby lake after drinking it. That is, I tried to jump into a lake. My butt hurt for a few days after that, but I found that I could walk on water.",
